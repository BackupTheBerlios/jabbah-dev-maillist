Subject: [Jabbah-dev] OpenSSL Digests Change
Message-ID: <20060716220914.GA17616@0xbadc0ffe.org>

Hello, im asking the oppinion of the others developers to change
the old sha1 interface.

Since the project will use ssl, and the openssl library(hopefully), i
change the code of the digest_pass(auth.c) to use openssl crypto.

Is anyone against that? Can i commit the changes in the cvs?

Ps: Since its my firts post, i will announce the changes that i
make in the code.

1: Change strcpy to the openbsd function strlcpy(more secure and
faster). Bytheway, strlcpy its not a default function, so, i include
it in common.c

2: Change in configure.in to identify openssl library(default)
3: Fix compiling error in message.
